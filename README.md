# Oyster_Inspectors
UMD Northrop Grumman Challenge Fall 2020

### Challenge Description
Northrop Grumman is excited to host a fully virtual student challenge this
semester! The challenge is open to both graduate and undergraduate students.
Participation includes video chat mentoring sessions, a midpoint review, office
hours, and a virtual final symposium in December.

Northrop Grumman is currently helping to develop an image/sonar system to monitor
Chesapeake Bay oyster fields for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. The challenge
objective is to determine the number of oysters—along with their health
status—automatically, from optical images, using a machine learning approach or
pattern recognition techniques. Students will be allowed to use Python and/or
MATLAB in order to complete this task. The results from this challenge can be
used to enhance health monitoring of the Chesapeake Bay. Training data will be
given to students, and test data will be supplied from CBF field surveys.
Students with some signal processing/software experience are preferred, but
there is no major requirement. The challenge can be completed individually or
in teams (1-4 individuals per team).
